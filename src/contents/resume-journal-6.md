In recent years, there has been an increasing interest in studying the various polymorphs of ice. A polymorph is a crystal structure that can occur in a single chemical compound. Scientists have discovered 17 different types of ice polymorphs, including some that are metastable (meaning they can only exist under certain conditions). One of the most intriguing discoveries in this field is the existence of ultralow-density ice polymorphs. These are ice crystals that have a lower density than normal ice, and they are thought to be stable under negative pressure.

Recently, a group of scientists led by Falenty et al. succeeded in producing a new type of ultralow-density ice, known as ice XVI. They did this by vacuum pumping neon hydrate in a laboratory. This ice is particularly interesting because its porous structure was predicted by computer simulations before it was actually discovered. The same methodology was used to produce another ultralow-density ice, known as ice XVII, which is filled with hydrogen.

Many other hypothetical ices have been produced using computer simulations. For example, Conde et al. predicted that a type of ice clathrate known as empty sH clathrate hydrate would be more stable than any other known ice phases under extreme negative pressures. Similarly, Huang et al. proposed that two ultralow-density ice phases would occupy wide areas in the phase diagram of water at negative pressures. They searched for possible stable ice structures using a Monte Carlo packing algorithm and evaluated their thermodynamic stabilities using a combination of DFT calculations and classical molecular dynamics (MD) simulations.

One of the most exciting findings in this research is that these hypothetical ultralow-density ice polymorphs have a similar structure to certain types of silica (a mineral that is a component of glass and sand). This isomorphism (similarity in crystal structure) between ice and silica is a fascinating discovery that could have important implications for our understanding of ice and other materials.

The research group has also proposed a new ice clathrate with a record low density, which is named ice XIX, as a potential candidate in the guest-free form. This discovery is significant because it suggests that there may be many more undiscovered ice polymorphs with unique properties yet to be discovered.

In conclusion, the phase diagram of ice polymorphs under negative pressure is a rapidly developing field of research, with many exciting discoveries being made. The isomorphism between ice and silica, and the prediction of a new ice clathrate with record low density, is just a glimpse of what we can expect to learn in the future. The potential applications of these findings are far-reaching, and we look forward to seeing how they will be used in the future.
