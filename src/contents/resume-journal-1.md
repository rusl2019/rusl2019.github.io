description: Hypothetical ultralow-density ice predict with computer simulation
---

Water is a unique substance in that it has a vast number of polymorphs. A total of 17 ice polymorphs, including metastable ones, have been discovered experimentally. This is quite unusual for a pure substance. The abundance of ice polymorphs is due to the fact that water molecules have a preference for a tetrahedrally directed network topology because of the hydrogen bonds.

Some of the ice polymorphs were discovered very recently, and they are of particular interest because they are less dense than normal ice and are stable under negative pressure. In 2014, Falenty et al. successfully produced empty sII clathrate hydrate by vacuum pumping of neon hydrate, and this ice was named ice XVI. The existence of this porous ice was initially predicted theoretically and its properties were surveyed by computer simulations. The same methodology was applied to hydrogen-filled ice C0 to produce ice XVII.

Many hypothetical ices have been produced by computer simulations. Conde et al. predicted that empty sH clathrate hydrate is more stable than any other known ice phases under extreme negative pressures. Recently, Huang et al. proposed that two ultralow-density ice phases occupy wide areas in the phase diagram of water at negative pressures. They searched for possible stable ice structures using a Monte Carlo packing algorithm and evaluated the thermodynamic stability of them using a combination of DFT calculations and classical molecular dynamics (MD) simulations with the TIP4P/2005 water force field.

The network structures of the two stable low-density ice phases are the same as the zeolite frameworks of RHO and FAU. They have been named ice RHO and ice FAU. The network structures of ice XVI and the empty sH clathrate hydrate are the same as the MTN and DOH zeolite frameworks, respectively, and thus have been referred to as ice MTN and ice DOH.

In conclusion, the discovery of ultralow-density ice polymorphs is a significant advancement in the field of water research. These hypothetical ices have the potential to provide insights into the properties of water under extreme conditions and may have potential applications in various industries. Further research is needed to fully understand and utilize these unique ice polymorphs.
