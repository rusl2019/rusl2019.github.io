description: Isomorphism between ice and silica
---

Ice and silica are two very different materials, but they have a surprising similarity: both have many different crystal structures, or polymorphs. While ice is a common substance found in nature, silica is a mineral that is the main component of sand and glass. However, both have a wide range of crystal structures, and scientists have been working to understand the relationship between these polymorphs.

Recent research has revealed that there is an isomorphism, or similarity in structure, between ice and silica. This is because both substances have tetrahedrally directed network topologies, which means that the atoms or molecules in the crystal structure are arranged in a specific way. This is due to the hydrogen bonds in ice, and the silica tetrahedra in silica.

Scientists have found that there are 17 ice polymorphs, including metastable ones, and many hypothetical ices have been produced by computer simulations. Conde et al. predicted that empty sH clathrate hydrate is more stable than any other known ice phases under extreme negative pressures. Recently, Huang et al. proposed that two ultralow-density ice phases occupy wide areas in the phase diagram of water at negative pressures. They searched for possible stable ice structures by a Monte Carlo packing algorithm and evaluated thermodynamic stabilities of them by the combination of DFT calculations and classical molecular dynamics (MD) simulations with the TIP4P/2005 water force field.

The network structures of the two stable low-density ice phases are the same as the zeolite frameworks of RHO and FAU. These ice polymorphs are referred to as ice RHO and ice FAU, respectively. This isomorphism between ice and silica is important because it allows scientists to understand the properties of these different crystal structures and how they may be used in different applications.

It is worth mentioning that some of the ice polymorphs were discovered very recently, they are of particular interest because they are less dense than normal ice and are supposed to be stable under negative pressure. Falenty et al. succeeded to produce empty sII clathrate hydrate by vacuum pumping of neon hydrate in 2014, and this ice was named ice XVI. Existence of this porous ice was originally predicted theoretically, and its properties were surveyed by computer simulations. The same methodology was applied to hydrogen-filled ice C0 to produce ice XVII.

Understanding the relationship between these different polymorphs of ice and silica is crucial for many industries. For example, in the oil and gas industry, clathrate hydrates can form in pipelines and cause blockages, so understanding the properties of these structures is important for preventing these problems. Similarly, in the field of materials science, understanding the properties of these different polymorphs can lead to the development of new materials with unique properties.

In conclusion, the discovery of the isomorphism between ice and silica is an important step in understanding the properties of these different crystal structures. This knowledge can be used to develop new materials and technologies, and to improve our understanding of the behavior of these substances under different conditions.
