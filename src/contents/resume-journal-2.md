description: Mechanical stability of ice polymorphs under negative pressure
---

Water is a unique substance in that it has a wide variety of crystal structures, known as ice polymorphs. Recent research has focused on studying these polymorphs under negative pressure, as they have the potential to be stable in this unusual condition. This is particularly interesting because some of the recently discovered ice polymorphs, such as ice XVI and ice XVII, are less dense than normal ice.

In 2014, Falenty et al. were able to produce a new type of ice, known as empty sII clathrate hydrate or ice XVI, by vacuum pumping neon hydrate. This ice had been predicted theoretically and its properties were surveyed through computer simulations. The same methodology was used to produce ice XVII, which is a hydrogen-filled version of ice C0.

Many hypothetical ices have been produced through computer simulations, and one of the most promising is the empty sH clathrate hydrate. It has been predicted that this ice is more stable than any other known ice phase under extreme negative pressures. Recently, Huang et al. proposed that two ultralow-density ice phases, known as ice RHO and ice FAU, occupy wide areas in the phase diagram of water at negative pressures.

The researchers used a combination of DFT calculations and classical molecular dynamics (MD) simulations with the TIP4P/2005 water force field to evaluate the thermodynamic stabilities of these ice phases. They found that the network structures of ice RHO and ice FAU are similar to zeolite frameworks of RHO and FAU. They also found that the network structures of ice XVI and ice DOH are similar to the MTN and DOH zeolite frameworks.

In conclusion, this research has shed light on the potential for stable ultralow-density ice polymorphs under negative pressure. The phase diagram of ice polymorphs under negative pressure and the limits of mechanical stability needs to be further investigated. This could lead to new applications in fields such as cryogenics and materials science.
