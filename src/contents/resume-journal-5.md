description: Many potential structures for clathrate hydrates although only a few structures have been found experimentally
---

Water is a unique substance in that it has a wide variety of crystal structures, known as polymorphs. To date, scientists have discovered 17 different ice polymorphs, including metastable ones. This is unusual for a pure substance, and the variety of ice polymorphs is thought to be due to the preference of water molecules for a tetrahedrally directed network topology, as a result of hydrogen bonding.

One area of recent interest in the study of ice polymorphs is clathrate hydrates. These are ice-like structures that form when small molecules, such as gases or guest molecules, become trapped within the ice lattice. Clathrate hydrates are of particular interest because they are less dense than normal ice and are thought to be stable under negative pressure.

Recently, scientists have been able to produce a new clathrate hydrate, known as empty sII clathrate hydrate or ice XVI, by vacuum pumping neon hydrate. This ice was originally predicted theoretically, and its properties were surveyed by computer simulations. The same methodology was applied to hydrogen-filled ice C0, resulting in the production of ice XVII.

Many hypothetical ices have also been produced by computer simulations. Conde et al. predicted that empty sH clathrate hydrate is more stable than any other known ice phases under extreme negative pressures. Huang et al. recently proposed that two ultralow-density ice phases occupy wide areas in the phase diagram of water at negative pressures. They searched for possible stable ice structures by a Monte Carlo packing algorithm and evaluated thermodynamic stabilities of them by the combination of DFT calculations and classical molecular dynamics (MD) simulations with the TIP4P/2005 water force field. The network structures of the two stable low-density ice phases are the same as the zeolite frameworks of RHO and FAU.

The discovery of these hypothetical ices raises many questions about the structure selectivity of clathrate hydrates. The isomorphism, or similarity in structure, between ice and silica, raises the possibility that clathrate hydrates may have similar structure selectivity to zeolites, a type of silica mineral. This opens up new avenues for research into the properties of clathrate hydrates, and their potential applications in areas such as gas storage and separation.

In conclusion, the study of ice polymorphs and clathrate hydrates is an active and rapidly advancing field. The discovery of new hypothetical ices under negative pressure, and the isomorphism between ice and silica, suggest that there may be many more ice polymorphs yet to be discovered. Further research into the structure selectivity of clathrate hydrates has the potential to lead to new breakthroughs in the field of materials science.
