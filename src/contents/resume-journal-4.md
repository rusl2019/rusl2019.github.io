description: The phase diagram of water at negative pressures
---

Ice is a fascinating substance that has many different crystal structures, known as polymorphs. While it is not uncommon for a pure substance to have multiple crystal structures, the large number of ice polymorphs is particularly intriguing. Scientists have discovered 17 different ice polymorphs, including some that are metastable, meaning they can exist under certain conditions but are not the most stable form of the substance.

Recently, scientists have been studying ice polymorphs that are less dense than normal ice and are stable under negative pressure. These "ultralow-density ice phases" are of particular interest because they have unique properties that are different from other known ice phases. For example, some of these ice polymorphs are porous, and some are even less dense than water itself.

One of the most exciting things about the study of these ultralow-density ice phases is that many of them were predicted theoretically and then discovered through computer simulations. This means that scientists are able to use computer simulations to explore the properties of these hypothetical ice polymorphs without having to physically create them in the lab.

In 2014, scientists were able to produce a type of ice called "Ice XVI" by vacuum pumping neon hydrate. This ice is less dense than normal ice and is stable under negative pressure. Similarly, scientists were able to produce "Ice XVII" by filling hydrogen-filled ice C0.

Recently, scientists have been exploring the possibility of other stable ice structures by using a Monte Carlo packing algorithm and evaluating their thermodynamic stabilities through a combination of DFT calculations and classical molecular dynamics simulations.

The study of these ultralow-density ice phases has led to some interesting discoveries about the relationship between ice and other substances. For example, the network structures of some of these ice polymorphs are the same as the zeolite frameworks of RHO and FAU. This isomorphism between ice and silica is a fascinating area of research that could lead to new insights into the properties and behavior of these substances.

In conclusion, the study of ultralow-density ice phases under negative pressures is an exciting area of research that could lead to new discoveries about the properties and behavior of water. The use of computer simulations to explore the properties of these hypothetical ice polymorphs has been particularly valuable in this area of research. As scientists continue to study these virtual ices, we can expect to learn more about the phase diagram of water at negative pressures and the isomorphism between ice and silica.
