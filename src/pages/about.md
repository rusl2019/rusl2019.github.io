Hello World! My name is Ruslan. I am a chemist majoring in physical
chemistry, specifically in mechanical classical and mechanical
statistic. My area of interest is gas hydrate (ice crystal) and computer
simulation methods such as Molecular Dynamics (MD) and Monte Carlo (MC)
simulation. In my free time, I enjoy programming computer applications,
listening to podcasts, playing games, and playing music.
